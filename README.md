# Tech Blog

## Purpose
This website is designed to allow users to post blogs. When visited for the first time, the blog displays a homepage with existing blogs along with a navigation bar. The navigation bar consists of a link to the dashboard. If registered and logged in, the user can acess this page. The dashboard displays a form to allow users to add blogs. Under the form are all the blogs the logged in user has posted. The user will have the option to either add comments to his own blog or edit said blogs. The user can also comment on other users' blogs by going back on the homepage, clicking the titles, and typing the comments into the textarea. Once the user is finished using the site, the user can logout. A successful logout will be indicated by the disappearing greetings.
